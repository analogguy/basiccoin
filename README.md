# basiccoin
This is my first attempt to make the most basic blockchain, named basiccoin .
As I have interest in Blockchain and just basic proficiency in python, I have decided to do projects alongwith increasing my hold on language. For which this is my first project. For this code I have taken help from code written by Gerald Nash. With time I plan to write a code that is purely written by me.
